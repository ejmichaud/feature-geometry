Executing these notebooks requires the feature occurrence and cooccurrence statistics, and expects them in an `experiments/all-occurrences0/`directory. You can download the `histograms` results here https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/h8ykuammi9zgom7ju1tkm/ALyP2zoMxZNEpeaVnJ6IjHo?rlkey=wf3zr8pf4jd6vw7gfcztld22g&st=espzrer9&dl=0 and the `cooc-histograms` results here https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/vepzp3vgqmb4urxm90ob4/ANOQDm9mGbxST9fvLpEbylA?rlkey=if0c8uq06usui86a1mwdtxoux&st=5uk3tc2f&dl=0

The data in these were generated by the scripts in the `scripts/` directory. You can see how these were run by looking at the `experiments/all-occurrences0/run.sh` and `experiments/all-occurrences0/cooc-run.sh` scripts.
