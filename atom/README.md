# Crystal analysis: Section 3 of the paper

1. Activation differences are generated and plotted by `crystal_pca.py`.

2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is performed and visualized using `crystal_lda.py`.

3. Using activation differences, Figure 10 is generated by `crystal_interp_pc0.py`.

Executing codes requires [Function Vectors (Todd *et al.*)](https://github.com/ericwtodd/function_vectors) dataset to be cloned in this directory.
